What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

when you intialize a repository it tells git to start tracking changes ot the files
in that directory. it adds a few .git files into the directory and you can now check
the status of these files and start making commits. we dont know how to do that yet
but to start a repository type: git init
to get the status of a repo type: git status
