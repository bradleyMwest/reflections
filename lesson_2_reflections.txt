What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

when you intialize a repository it tells git to start tracking changes ot the files
in that directory. it adds a few .git files into the directory and you can now check
the status of these files and start making commits. we dont know how to do that yet
but to start a repository type: git init
to get the status of a repo type: git status

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to commit one file at a time from the current reposity.
This will ensure that you have one logical change per commit. This will help with debugging
