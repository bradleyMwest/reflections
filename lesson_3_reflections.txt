When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You want to do this to share your work collaborate with others. 
This lets you share your work and all your changes 
between multiple computers by cloning the repository and 
included changes made by other people to your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This way you are constantly monitoring the changes that are being made
and you can avoid having code that doesnt work any more
because someone else commited a bug that may be difficult for you to find
